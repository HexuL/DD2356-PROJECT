# serial versionï¼š

**seq is a file related to serial code, including the following files:**

1. **seq.c**: The main file of the serial version. The function of saving data is to make the simulation more visual, but it takes a lot of time, so when measuring the program running time, it is necessary to comment the following code:

   ```c
           // Save state for plotting in real time
           if (plotRealTime || t >= tEnd) {
               char filename[50];
               sprintf(filename, "%s/output_%d.txt", dirName, outputCount);
               save_to_file(U, mask, N, filename);
               outputCount++;
           }
   ```

2. **final_show.py**: draws a graph based on the final data saved in finitedifference.txt.

3. **outputdata_show.py**: Dynamically simulates the data generated by all the calculation processes saved in the outputdata file. If you need to save the data and simulate dynamically, remember to adjust the relevant code in seq.c.

4. **html**: Documentation generated with Doxygen.
